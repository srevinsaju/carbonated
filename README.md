# carbonic

A simple python carbon engine which introduces as many bonds (single, double or triple) as required. **carbonic** algorithm checks for exception through gui and makes safe alteration to the structure.

## Why carbonic?
I chose the name 'carbonic' because, it is not about carbonic acids and other unrelated stuff but, instead, a small abbreviation for **CARBON** **I**n **C**ode.

## Installation

carbonic can be run directly from executable on Windows and Linux from Releases. For Mac OS, the software has to be built from source (as I don't have a Mac device).

### Steps to install:

1. (Also Step 0), Put a star on my github repo, it gives some self-confidence üòâ

2. Go to [releases](https://github.com/srevinsaju/carbonic/releases), and download the latest release for your Operating System.

3. Run the Portable Executable file which runs offline, and Enjoy! 

## Building from Source

Building from Source is easy as pie with python3 as the coding language. Before you proceed, make sure you have python3 installed on your OS.

* Clone my github repo by: <p>`git clone https://github.com/srevinsaju/carbonic.git`
* Type `cd carbonic`
* Install the dependencies by typing <p>
a) Windows: `pip install PyQt5` <p>
b) Linux or Mac: `pip3 install PyQt5`
* Run in terminal `python3 main.py` on Linux or Mac and `python main.py` on Windows.


## Future Releases:
* Add other functional groups support to Carbon Structure.
* Make AI more smarter. üòéüê±‚Äçüë§

## Contribute
Small AIs are made great with societal support. Pull Requests, Contributors and Issues help devleop great software from scratch. Your support is highly appreciated!
