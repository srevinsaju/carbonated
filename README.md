# carbonic

A simple python carbon engine which introduces as many bonds (single, double or triple) as required. **carbonic** algorithm checks for exception through gui and makes safe alteration to the structure.

## Why carbonic?
I chose the name 'carbonic' because, it is not about carbonic acids and other unrelated stuff but, instead, a small abbreviation for **CARBON** **I**n **C**ode.

## Installation

carbonic can be run directly from executable on Windows and Linux from Releases. For Mac OS, the software has to be built from source (as I don't have a Mac device).

### Steps to install:

1. (Also Step 0), Put a star on my github repo, it gives some self-confidence üòâ

2. Go to [releases](https://github.com/srevinsaju/carbonic/releases), and download the latest release for your Operating System.

3. Run the Portable Executable file which runs offline, and Enjoy! 

## Building from Source

Building from Source is easy as pie with python3 as the coding language. Before you proceed, make sure you have python3 installed on your OS.
